    <h1>Ping a Website</h1>
    <p>Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet
        Protocol (IP) network. It measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating host to a
        destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The name comes from active sonar terminology that sends
        a pulse of sound and listens for the echo to detect objects under water.</p>
